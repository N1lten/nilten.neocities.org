Working Title: Once, there was a Katamari

Sum notes:
- OH GODDIE YES DADDY BANDAI NAMCO LET ME SIGN MY SOUL AWAY TO PLAY YOUR VIDOGAEM AND WHILE WERE AT IT: WANT MY SECURITY NUMBER OF MY CEREDIT CARD AS WELL?! (do something creative here with css' transform properties, to overlay an image of the bandai namco tos over the text talking about starting the game)
- the prince is fat. In other words: what happened to the stamina?
- where physical europe release?
- the select scroll is so goofy i freaking love it !
- the new soundtrack FUUUUCKKSSS (in a chapter called "If you know anything about katamari you may already know what i'll talk about next." oh and mention the way katamari on the doun is implemented into the tutorial stage !)
- Stupid "I love katamari... no WE love katamari!" joke in the intro with a sketch of miles standing on a stage with a mic and a painful grin on his face and the caption "COMEDY GENIUS MILES NILTEN, EVERYBODY ! clap now."
- Katamari has CINEMA NOW ?! (cutscenes within levels)
- "Welcome back to watchmojo, where we will be talking about the top ten sexual references in videogames made for children. make sure to follow us on onlyfans-" insert the king talking about a mushroom shaped toy from the tutorial stage here

Intro:
Once upon a time, there was a game called "Katamari Damacy". It was a game like no other. At a time, where the technology in video games got progressively better and better over the years, this game really stood out in the ever growing video game market. I mean, what games usualy come to mind, when you think of the year 2004? GTA: San Andreas? Half-Life 2? They all mostly feature the same kinds of technical improvements. More realistic graphics, better sound and all that neat stuff compared to their previous entries ! Katamari Damacy is not one of those games.  

Music:
I think one of the best examples of how the new soundtrack suprised me is the tutorial stage of this game. You're just standing there, as the prince, waiting for the king to finish his monolouge without any kind of music playing during that moment. But as soon as you finally get your hands on your katamari, the song "Katamari on the Doun" starts blasting in your ears and you just sit there, thinking to yourself: "Awww hell yeah ! Katamari is back, baby !" As if this song was chosen intentionally by the developers as some sort of welcome back message to old fans of katamari damacy, after the 14 year long hiatus of the series !











<p>Once upon a time, there was a game called Katamari Damacy. It was a game like no other. At a time, where the technology in video games progressively got better and better over the years, this game really stood out from the crowd of the ever growing video game market. I mean, what games usualy come to mind, when you think of the year 2004? GTA: San Andreas? Half-Life 2? They all mostly feature the same technical improvements. More realistic graphics, better sound and all that neat stuff compared to their previous entries ! Katamari Damacy is not one of those games. Not only wasn't it a sequel to a well established and beloved video game franchise, but it also didn't feature an "realistic" graphics, most early- to mid 2000's games are known for. Katamari Damacy didn't need all of that. It simply stayed true to itself ! Created by japanese artist and video game developer Keita Takahashi and released on the 18rd of March 2004 in Japan and a few months later, on Septmeber 21st 2004 in North America, this game quickly took the world by storm ! In Katamari Damacy, you take control of the Prince who's father, the King of all Cosmos, accidentily destroyed all the stars in the galaxy, after having one too many drinks. So the King tasks the Prince with rolling a sticky ball, called the katamari, on earth to replace the stars in the night sky. it quickly found a huge fanbase. Katamari Damacy had such a big impact, a playable demo of the game was even displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Fans all over the world loved Katamari Damacy's unique nature ! There just weren't that many games like it on the market at that time ! But with an average playtime of about 6 hours, this game could easily be finished in one evening and the fans cried out for more ! Namco heard the wishes of the fans, and plans were set in motion to develop a sequel to Katamari Damacy, although series creator Keita Takahashi wasn't so fond of the idea of a "Katamari Damacy 2". After learning however, that Namco would continue to develop Katamari games without him on board, Takahashi decided to help produce the sequel to Katamari Damacy, so fans wouldn't be disapointed. After the release of "We Love Katamari" in 2005, Takahashi went to work on other projects inside Namco until leaving the company in 2009.</p>
