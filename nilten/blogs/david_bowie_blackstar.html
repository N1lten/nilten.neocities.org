David Bowie's Blackstar and the Topic of death

Something happened on the day he died. Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside. Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried: "I'm a black star. I'm a black star."

Ten years ago today, Starman David Bowie has stepped of the face of this earth, succumbing to his 18 month long battle with liver cancer. Bowies last work of art was Black Star, his 26th and final studio album released on the 8th of January 2016, the same date as bowie's 69th birthday. Two day later, bowie passed away.
So... what makes this album so special?
