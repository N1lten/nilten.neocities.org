<p style="text-decoration: underline; width: 75%; display: block; margin: auto;">Something happened on the day he died. Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside. Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried: <i>"I'm a black star. I'm a black star."</i></p>
<br>
<p>Ten years ago today, Starman David Bowie has stepped of the face of earth, succumbing to his 18 month long battle with liver cancer. Bowie's last work was Blackstar, his 26th and final studio album released on the 8th of January 2016, the same date as Bowie's 69th birthday. Just two days after the release of Blackstar, Bowie passed away.</p>
<br>
<h1>Part 1: Starman</h1>

<p>David Bowie is a name which most of you will probably have heard of at least once. He was among one of the most legendary musicians in recent history, selling over 100 milion records worldwide and redefining the glam rock genre.</p>
<p>Even if his name doesn't imediately ring a bell to you, you will most likely have heard his songs at least once in your life before ! <br> Space Oddity, Let's Dance, Heroes, Ziggy Stardust, Starman, Ashes to Ashes and of course his legendary cover of Martha and the Vandellas' Dancing in the Street he did together with Mick Jagger.</p>
<p>Bowie was a legendary musician through and through. His fascination for the space echos throughout his works and has always been a big part of his career, like his alter ego Major Tom, who's a lonely Astronaut in space. Or his other alter ego Ziggy Stardust: An alien rockstar from space, who lands on a dying earth.</p>

<p>During his carrer Bowie also worked on other projects. For example, he wrote the title track to the movie adaptation of <i style="text-decoration:underline;">When the Wind Blows</i> from 1986, based on the visual novel of the same name by Raymond Briggs. But not only did he focus on music, as he also did some acting jobs over the years.</p>
<p>One of his most notable acting works is his leading role as <i>Thomas Jerome Newton</i>, an alien from outer space who lands on earth, to find a way to save his home planet, in the 1976 movie <i style="text-decoration:underline;">The Man Who Fell to Earth</i>.</p>
<p>Bowie even starred in a few tv commercials of the now defunct XM Satellite Radio Channel among other celebrities like Snoop Dogg. In one commercial, Bowie falls through the roof of a motel, landing in the room of an elderly cupple and boy i'd be lying if i didn't say that i'd be one happy little fella if David Bowie himself crashed through the roof of my house landing in my room !</p>
<p>His works definitely mean a lot to me personaly. I still listen to his discography on a regular basis. He really made a lot of amazing songs over the years which easily can get stuck in your head ! Especially Space Oddity, which still manages to choke me up after countless of replays over the years, which is why i actually try to avoid listening to this song in public.</p>

<br>

<p>But now that begs the question... what makes his final album, Blackstar, so special?</p>

<br>
<h1>Part 2: Blackstar</h1>

<p>Blackstar is seen as David Bowie's goodbye to his fans. A swan song recorded and produced after being diagnosed with a terminal illness.</p> 
<p>In the summer of 2014, a few months before recordings for Blackstar began, Bowie was diagnosed with liver cancer. A diagnosis, which hasn't been made pubilc up until his death in january of 2016. But instead of resting for his final months of life, Bowie used this oppertunity to center his next and final peice of art around his face-off with death himself.</p>
<p>Death is a topic which is heavily featured throughout the songs in Blackstar. Some of Bowie's earlier works also have touched upon death every now and then. But now that David Bowie knew his life would be cut short soon, Blackstar really leans into that teritory.</p>
<br>
<p>This album is way more experimental in it's execution than previous albums from David Bowie, as Blackstar incorperates new ideas, like a jazz arangement, which David Bowie hasn't worked with before in his previous albums. Generally it's said that Blackstar is made up of a mix of art rock and jazz rock.</p>
<p>Blackstar was made possible by the help of Bowie's long time co-producer Tony Visconti, who also helped to produce some of Bowie's first albums in the late 60s, and Donny McCaslin and his jazz quartet, who Bowie first met in the summer of 2014 at a jazz club in New York.</p>
<p>Similarily to Bowie's previous album, <i style="text-decoration: underline;">The Next Day</i>, Blackstar was produced in secret and every artist involved in this project had to sign non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>The legendary box art for this album was done by <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Jonathan Barnbrook</i>, who has also worked with Bowie in the past, designing the covers of <i>The Next Day</i>, <i>Reality</i> and <i>Heathen</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>The album itself is comprised of seven Songs. Two of which, <i style="text-decoration:underline;">Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)</i> and <i style="text-decoration:underline;">Tis' A Pitty She Was A Whore</i>, were both originaly recorded and released as singles a few years earlier, but were re-recorded for Blackstar with a different arrangement to fit in line with the general sound of the album.</p>
<p>Tony Visconti stated, that both him and Bowie were heavily inspiered by Kendrik Lamar's <i style="text-decoration: underline;">To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, which made a lasting impact on both of them and gave them a rough idea for the sound of Blackstar.</p>
<br>
<p>As stated earlier, the songs on Blackstar all feature the topic of death in some shape or form. Take, for example, the song <i style="text-decoration:underline;">Lazarus</i>, the third track and one of my personal favourite songs on the album.</p>
<p>The music video depicts a man with covered eyes, played by David Bowie himself, lying on what persumably is his death bed. The man looks frail and seems to slightly float above his bed, like a soul leaving the body after death, while singing <i>"Oh, i'll be free. Just like that blue bird."</i></p>
<p>The name <i>Lazarus</i> itself is likely a reference to a figure of the bible named <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Lazarus of Bethany</i>, who was resurected four days after his death. Similarily to how the popularity of Blackstar skyrocketed, after David Bowie's death had been announced.</p>
<br>
<p>Another song on Blackstar i really enjoy is <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Dollar Days</i>, the sixth track of the album. Dollar Days' lyrics have a double meaning, where the lines <i style="text-decoration: underline;">"I'm dying to"</i> can easily be understood as <i style="text-decoration: underline;">"I'm dying too"</i>.</p>
<p>The album ends with the song <i style="text-decoration:underline;">I Can't Give Everything Away</i>, a very cryptic but also personal and final message to all fans. A form of eulogy, stating that there will be some things about his life that Bowie will take to his grave in his final moments.</p>
<br>
<h1>Part 3: Returning to Space</h1>

<p>Blackstar toped charts worldwide shortly after it's release. It won five Grammys in 2016 and it was Bowie's first ever album to top the Billboard 200 in the U.S. and went on to become the top 5 best selling album of 2016.<br> David Bowie however wouldn't see the success of Blackstar.</p>
<p>The death of David Bowie changed the way people viewed this album as soon as the message of his death has spread. It wasn't just the release of a new album by a legendary musician, of whom the world hasn't heard from that much the years prior.<br> It was Bowie's parting gift. A way to say goodbye and thank all his fans and in some form a self epitaph.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's actually quite impressive to think, that David Bowie turned his own death into a piece of art. Even in his last months he was still driven to make art, in turn solidifying his legacy as an icon in music history. Blackstar truly holds a special place in my heart and so does David Bowie !</p>
<p>If you haven't listened to Blackstar before, i highly recommend giving it a listen ! And while you're at it, you should also listen to the rest of his discography if you haven't done so either, as Bowie really made some amazing songs in his lifetime !</p>
<p>Though Bowie may be gone, the unprecedented success of Blackstar could be seen as some sort of rebirth or immortalisation.  With it a whole new generation became aware of Bowie's legacy.</p>
<p>Maybe Blackstar wasn't the end after all. Perhaps David Bowie still lives on as a Blackstar somewhere in space. That same place which fascinated him for all his life.</p>
<br>
<p>Thank You for everything, David Bowie <3</p>
